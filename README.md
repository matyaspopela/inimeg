> **Transform the Gemini CLI from a chat assistant into a Principal Technical Consultant.**

This kit is a battle-tested configuration suite for the [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google/gemini-cli). It provides a structured hierarchy of roles, commands, and memory systems designed to enforce architectural rigor, automate quality assurance, and mentor developers through complex technical decisions.

---

## ✨ Key Superpowers

*   **🛡️ Governance First:** Implements a "No Code Without Specs" policy.
*   **🧪 TDD Automation:** Built-in Red-Green-Refactor cycles for Django and React.
*   **🔍 Deep Auditing:** Specialized agents for security, performance, and style reviews.
*   **🧠 Persistent Memory:** A multi-layered memory system that tracks architecture, constraints, and past failures.
*   **🏫 Integrated Mentorship:** Reviews that explain the *why*, elevating your team's technical bar.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation
Clone this kit or copy the `.gemini/` folder into the root of your existing project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gemini-engineering-kit.git
cp -r gemini-engineering-kit/.gemini /your/project/path/
```

### 2. Initialization
Launch the Gemini CLI in your project root and run the re-indexing command:

```bash
/setrepo
```

*This command triggers a deep scan of your codebase, auto-detecting frameworks, entry points, and dependencies to populate the internal cache.*

## 🛠️ The Command Suite

| Command | Specialized Agent | Mission |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`/plan`** | **Architect** | Requirements analysis & spec generation. (Run this before coding!) |
| **`/tdd`** | **Engineer** | Test-Driven Development cycles (Red-Green-Refactor). |
| **`/audit`** | **Auditor** | Security, architecture, and quality deep-dives. |
| **`/refactor`** | **Specialist** | Code modernization and complexity reduction. |
| **`/mentor`** | **Staff Lead** | Educational reviews focused on senior-level principles (SOLID, DRY). |
| **`/docit`** | **Historian** | Synchronizes code changes with system documentation. |

## 🏗️ System Structure

The kit organizes the agent's "brain" into three distinct layers:

### 1. Directives (`.gemini/rules/` & `.gemini/policy/`)
The foundational "Laws of Behavior". Includes the **Zero Clutter Protocol**, **Interrogation Protocols** (asking for logs instead of guessing), and **Security Hygiene**.

### 2. Memory (`.gemini/memory/`)
*   **`ARCHITECTURE.md`**: The source of truth for your system's design.
*   **`CONSTRAINTS.md`**: Hard guardrails (e.g., "Must use TypeScript", "Postgres-only").
*   **`FAILURES.md`**: A learning journal of past technical mistakes to avoid repetition.

### 3. Cache (`.gemini/cache/`)
Transient data generated by `/setrepo` that gives the agent a real-time map of your codebase symbols and entry points.

---

## ⚙️ Customization

1.  **Define your Constraints:** Update `.gemini/memory/CONSTRAINTS.md` with your project-specific rules.
2.  **Set the Persona:** Modify `.gemini/rules/persona.md` to adjust the tone (e.g., more collaborative vs. more authoritative).
3.  **Add Commands:** Drop new `.toml` files into `.gemini/commands/` to create custom agents.
