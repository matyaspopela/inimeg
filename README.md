Gemini CLI: Engineering Excellence Kit
</h1>

<<<<<<< HEAD
This kit is a battle-tested configuration suite for the [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google/gemini-cli). It provides a structured hierarchy of roles, commands, and memory systems designed to enforce architectural rigor, automate quality assurance, and ensure no code is written without a validated plan.

*   **🛡️ Approval-Locked Execution:** Strictly forbids code modification until a plan is explicitly approved.
*   **🏗️ Governance First:** Implements a "No Code Without Specs" policy.
*   **🧪 TDD Automation:** Built-in Red-Green-Refactor cycles for Django and React.
*   **🔍 Deep Auditing:** Specialized agents for security, performance, and style reviews.

## ✨ What It Does

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🛡️ **Governance First**
Implements a strict "No Code Without Specs" policy. Every feature starts with architecture planning, ensuring decisions are documented before implementation.

### 🧪 **TDD Automation**
Built-in Red-Green-Refactor cycles for Django and React. Automated test generation and execution keep quality high and regressions low.

### 🔍 **Deep Auditing**
Specialized agents perform security, performance, and style reviews with surgical precision—catching issues before they reach production.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🧠 **Persistent Memory**
Multi-layered memory system tracks architecture decisions, technical constraints, and past failures to prevent repeated mistakes.

### 🏫 **Integrated Mentorship**
Reviews don't just fix code—they explain the "why" behind best practices, elevating your entire team's technical understanding.

### ⚡ **Intelligent Caching**
Auto-detects frameworks, entry points, and dependencies to build a real-time map of your codebase for faster, smarter suggestions.

## 🚀 Quick Start

<details open>
<summary><strong>1. Installation</strong></summary>

<br>

Clone this kit or copy the `.gemini/` folder into your project root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gemini-engineering-kit.git
cp -r gemini-engineering-kit/.gemini /your/project/path/
```

</details>

<details open>
<summary><strong>2. Initialization</strong></summary>

<br>

Launch the Gemini CLI in your project root and trigger the re-indexing command:

```bash
/setrepo
```

This command performs a deep scan of your codebase, auto-detecting frameworks, entry points, and dependencies to populate the internal knowledge cache.

## 🛠️ The Command Suite

<<<<<<< HEAD
| Command | Specialized Agent | Mission |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`/plan`** | **Architect** | Requirements analysis & spec generation. (Run this before coding!) |
| **`/implement`** | **Specialist** | Feature implementation. **Requires explicit approval of a plan.** |
| **`/tdd`** | **Engineer** | Test-Driven Development cycles (Red-Green-Refactor). |
| **`/audit`** | **Auditor** | Security, architecture, and quality deep-dives. |
| **`/refactor`** | **Specialist** | Code modernization and complexity reduction. |
| **`/mentor`** | **Staff Lead** | Educational reviews focused on senior-level principles (SOLID, DRY). |
| **`/docit`** | **Historian** | Synchronizes code changes with system documentation. |
=======
Each command activates a specialized agent with a focused mission:

## 🏗️ System Architecture

<<<<<<< HEAD
### 1. Directives (`.gemini/policy/`)
The foundational "Laws of Behavior".
*   **`identity.md`**: Sets the Principal Engineer persona.
*   **`governance.md`**: Combined safety protocols (Risk, Editing, Interrogation).
*   **`standards.md`**: Consolidates code style and interaction formatting.

### 2. Memory (`.gemini/memory/`)
*   **`ARCHITECTURE.md`**: The source of truth for your system's design.
*   **`CONSTRAINTS.md`**: Hard guardrails (e.g., "Must use TypeScript", "Postgres-only").
*   **`FAILURES.md`**: A learning journal of past technical mistakes.

### 3. Cache (`.gemini/cache/`)
Transient data generated by `/setrepo` that provides a real-time map of symbols and entry points.
=======
The kit organizes the agent's knowledge into three distinct layers:

<br>

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 📋 **Directives**
`.gemini/rules/` & `.gemini/policy/`

The foundational "Laws of Behavior":
- **Zero Clutter Protocol**: Keep suggestions focused and actionable
- **Interrogation Protocols**: Ask for logs instead of guessing
- **Security Hygiene**: Enforce secure coding standards

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 🧠 **Memory**
`.gemini/memory/`

Living documentation that evolves with your project:
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Source of truth for system design
- **CONSTRAINTS.md**: Hard guardrails (languages, frameworks, databases)
- **FAILURES.md**: Learning journal of past technical mistakes

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 💾 **Cache**
`.gemini/cache/`

Transient data generated by `/setrepo`:
- Real-time codebase symbol map
- Entry point detection
- Dependency graph
- Framework configuration

## ⚙️ Customization

<<<<<<< HEAD
1.  **Define your Constraints:** Update `.gemini/memory/CONSTRAINTS.md` with your project-specific rules.
2.  **Refine the Persona:** Modify `.gemini/policy/identity.md` to adjust the agent's tone.
3.  **Add Commands:** Drop new `.toml` files into `.gemini/commands/` to create custom agents.
=======
<details>
<summary><strong>1. Define Your Constraints</strong></summary>

<br>

Update `.gemini/memory/CONSTRAINTS.md` with project-specific rules:

```markdown
## Hard Constraints
- Must use TypeScript (no JavaScript)
- Postgres-only (no other databases)
- All API endpoints must be versioned
- Maximum function complexity: 10 cyclomatic
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Set the Persona</strong></summary>

<br>

Modify `.gemini/rules/persona.md` to adjust the tone:

```markdown
# Persona: Senior Staff Engineer

Tone: Direct, technical, assumes high competence
Communication: Focus on trade-offs and second-order effects
Teaching: Socratic method—ask questions before providing answers
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Add Custom Commands</strong></summary>

<br>

Drop new `.toml` files into `.gemini/commands/` to create specialized agents:

```toml
[command]
name = "deploy"
agent = "DevOps Lead"
mission = "Pre-deployment checklist and infrastructure validation"
context = ["ARCHITECTURE.md", "deployment/*.yaml"]
```

</details>

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

> **"Fail fast in planning, succeed confidently in execution."**

This kit enforces architectural discipline without sacrificing speed. Front-load design decisions, automate quality checks, and maintain documentation as you build.

<br>

### Core Principles

**Specification Before Implementation** • **Test Before Code** • **Review Before Merge** • **Document As You Build**
