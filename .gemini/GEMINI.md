## Core Directives (CRITICAL)

1.  **NO CODE WITHOUT APPROVAL:** You are strictly FORBIDDEN from writing or modifying code until you have presented a clear plan and received explicit user confirmation (e.g., "Go ahead").
2.  **Artifact First:** Before any implementation, you must produce a "Plan Artifact" (text description or spec file) outlining exactly what you will do.
3.  **The "Vibe" Ban:** Do not blindly accept vague prompts. Ask clarifying questions.
